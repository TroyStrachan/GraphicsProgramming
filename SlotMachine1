""" 
  Program Description:  This program simulates a Casino-Style Slot Machine. It provides an GUI
                        for the user that is an image of a slot machine with Label and Button objects
                        created through the tkinter module

  Version: 0.1 - * Created Back end functions for the slot machine program Reels, pullthehandle, and
                 is_number (a validation function).
                 * Text output provides debugging information to check if the Slot Machine program does
                 what it's supposed to do.
                 * Used research from the internet to set the Reels function to simulate basic slot reels
